Welcome to PWAHStackTC!

The source code is in an Eclipse CDT (C++) project in the "Eclipse-C++" directory.

To build the executable for an experimental evaluation of PWAHStackTC, run "make" in the "Release" directory:
> cd Eclipse-C++/Release
> make
> ./PWAHStackTC --help
> ./PWAHStackTC --filename=mygraph.graph


More documentation can be found in the "doc" subdirectory. A good place to start looking is:
  doc/html/index.html

Which is the index page of the PWAHStackTC documentation (generated using Doxygen).

Enjoy!
